# Rutgers University Ph.D. Dissertation Latex Template

A latex template for Rutgers Ph.D. Dissertation. Last Updated 10/2019

## Introduction

This latex template is based on the style file by [rucsgss](https://github.com/rucsgss/thesis). I have made several necessary modifications according to the newest official [Rutgers University Thesis and Dissertation Style Guide](https://gsnb.rutgers.edu/academics/electronic-thesis-and-dissertation-style-guide). Dissertations using this template have been approved by [Graduate School](https://gsnb.rutgers.edu/academics/checklist-phd-degree) for 2019 October degree.

This template is best for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) students at Rutgers University-New Brunswick who need latex to present mathematical formulas and plots. If you are from [Newark](https://www.gsn.newark.rutgers.edu/phd) or [Camden](https://graduateschool.camden.rutgers.edu/files/Thesis-Style-Guide.pdf) campus, please make changes accordingly.

## How to use

[Download](https://github.com/steathy/rutgers-dissertation/archive/master.zip) the following three files and put them in the same directory:
- **_ruthesis.cls_** : This is the style file. DO NOT modify unless you understand what you are doing.
- **_dissertation.tex_** : This is the file where you write your dissertation to. Make sure you change it with your own personal information.

Please use a tex editor (for example, WinEdt) or notepad (not recommended) to edit these files.
